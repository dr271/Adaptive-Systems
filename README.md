# Adaptive-Systems
Given a simulated two-wheeled and non-inertial agent initialised in a random orientation at (0,0) on an infinite plane, we explore three potential methodologies to create controllers that are able to navigate it to a bright light located at (10,0), before returning to its origin as quickly as possible. In order to do this, the controller is able to take advantage of one noisy sensor, a forwards-facing photo sensor, as well as two noisy actuators, the left and right motors that form the agents differential drive mechanism.
